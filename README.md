# advent-of-code
My solutions and writeups for the 2024 Advent of Code.

Writeups are available on my [blog](https://astr0clad.github.io/blog/).

I'll make a table of contents eventually, but for now, you can navigate through the folders to find the solutions and writeups for each day. To try the solutions, make an input.txt file in the same directory as the python file and paste the input for the day in that file.
